            <p>
              Likewise, your data will be incorporated into the Clinical
              History, in accordance with article 14 of Law 41/2002, of November
              14, basic regulation of the patient's autonomy and of rights and
              obligations regarding clinical information and documentation, the
              Clinical history includes the set of documents related to the care
              processes of each patient, with the identification of the doctors
              and other professionals who have intervened in them, in order to
              obtain the maximum possible integration of the clinical
              documentation of each patient, at least, at the level of each
              center.
            </p>
            <p>
              In compliance with the aforementioned law, OMNIDOCTOR will archive
              the clinical histories of its Patients, whatever the paper,
              audiovisual, computer or other support in which they appear, so
              that their safety, correct conservation and recovery of
              information.
            </p>
            <p>
              The clinical history will incorporate the information that is
              considered transcendental for the accurate and updated knowledge
              of the patient's state of health. Every Patient or User has the
              right to record, in writing or in the most appropriate technical
              support, the information obtained in all their healthcare
              processes, carried out by the health service both in the field of
              primary care and specialized care. The clinical history will have
              as its main purpose to facilitate health care, recording all those
              data that, under medical criteria, allow accurate and up-to-date
              knowledge of the state of health.
            </p>
            <p>
              The medical history is an instrument intended primarily to ensure
              adequate patient care. The healthcare professionals of the center
              who carry out the diagnosis or treatment of the Patient have
              access to the patient's medical history as a fundamental
              instrument for their adequate care. OMNIDOCTOR will establish the
              methods that allow access to the clinical history of each patient
              at all times by the professionals who assist them. Only
              professionals involved in the patient care process will access the
              data from the medical record. The access of the management
              personnel will be limited to their functions. The personnel who
              access the data of the clinical history in the exercise of their
              functions are subject to the duty of secrecy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Patient has the right of access, with the reservations
              indicated in this section, to the documentation of the clinical
              history and to obtain a copy of the data that appears in it. The
              Patient, prior accreditation of his identity, may require
              OMNIDOCTOR by any means that records it, to deliver a copy of the
              data that appears in his medical history.
            </p>
            <p>
              The patient's right of access to the medical history can also be
              exercised by duly accredited representation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The patient's right of access to the documentation of the clinical
              history cannot be exercised to the detriment of the right of third
              parties to the confidentiality of the data contained therein
              collected in the therapeutic interest of the patient, or to the
              detriment of the right of the professionals participating in its
              elaboration, which can oppose the right of access the reservation
              of its subjective annotations.
            </p>
            <p>
              OMNIDOCTOR will only facilitate access to the clinical history of
              deceased patients to people linked to it, for family reasons or in
              fact, unless the deceased had expressly prohibited it and is thus
              proven. In any case, the access of a third party to the medical
              history due to a risk to their health will be limited to the
              relevant data. No information will be provided that affects the
              privacy of the deceased or the subjective notes of professionals,
              or that harms third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              OMNIDOCTOR has established a mechanism for active and diligent
              custody of medical records. Said custody allows the collection,
              integration, recovery and communication of the information subject
              to the principle of confidentiality.

                  some of Your medical history that might be critical to consult
                  You. The Medical Experts will not have the benefit of
                  information that would be obtained by examining You in person,
                  observing Your physical condition and by going through Your
                  medical records. This means that the Services provided is
